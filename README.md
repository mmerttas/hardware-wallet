# hardware-wallet

In this hardware design, it is aimed to create an Ethereum based PCB card for people to save their crypto currencies safely. Basic components of this design are Atmega168-20au, which is used as microcontroller and Nrf24l01, is used for RF communication and an OLED Screen with I2C communication is also used. Pcb, Sch and also the library files of this project can be found in this repository.

This project is an open-source, double-sided PCB design that uses https://firefly.city/ as fundamental source. It is designed by Mert Taş for https://palamutwallet.com/.
